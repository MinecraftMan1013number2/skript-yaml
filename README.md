# skript-yaml
The proper way to do yaml in skript

# NOTE 
This is a custom fork of skript-yaml.
An additional syntax from Skent has been added.

## Effects

### Effect (Load yaml)

Loads a yaml file into memory
  - If the file doesn't exist it will be created for you, no need to use other addons to create a file!
  - Using the optional `[non[(-| )]relative]` allows for root directory access
  - The first input is the yaml file path(ie. "plugins/MyAwesomePlugin/config.yml") (see example for root directories)
  - The second input allows you to choose your own id for this file
  - If the second input isn't used then the files name minus the extension is used as the id for example 'config.yml' becomes 'config'

#### Syntax

`[re]load [(1¦non[(-| )]relative)] [y[a]ml] %strings%`

`[re]load [(1¦non[(-| )]relative)] [y[a]ml] %string% as %string%`

`[re]load [(1¦non[(-| )]relative)] [y[a]ml] %strings% using [the] [file] path[s] as [the] id[s]`

#### Example

```
#Root directory
	#If the server is on drive D:\(on windows) for example then that would be the root path
	load non-relative yaml "RootFolder/MyAwesomePlugin/config.yml"
	#Otherwise you can specify a drive
	load non-relative yaml "C:/RootFolder/MyAwesomePlugin/config.yml"

#Both examples produce the same id for use in other effects/expressions
load yaml "plugins/MyAwesomePlugin/config.yml"
load yaml "plugins/MyAwesomePlugin/config.yml" as "config"


#to get similar function as the other addons you would do this sort of thing with the id...
	load yaml "plugins/MyAwesomePlugin/config.yml" as "plugins/MyAwesomePlugin/config.yml"
	set yaml value "version" from "plugins/MyAwesomePlugin/config.yml" to 1.0
	broadcast "%yaml value "version" from "plugins/MyAwesomePlugin/config.yml"%"
```


---

### Effect (Load all yaml from directory)
Loads a directory YAML files into memory.
  - The input is a directory (ie. \"plugins/MyAwesomePlugin/\").
  - If for example a file in that directory is named test.yml then the output ID would be 'plugins/MyAwesomePlugin/test.yml'
  - Using the optional filename ID would output `test.yml`"

#### Syntax

`[re]load all [y[a]ml] from [(1¦non[(-| )]relative)] director(y|ies) %strings% [using [the] filename as [the] id]`

#### Example

```
#This isn't something you would really want to do, or is it?
load all yaml from directory "plugins/skript-yaml/test"
	loop all of the currently loaded yaml files:
		loop yaml nodes "" from loop-value-1:
			loop yaml nodes loop-value-2 from loop-value-1:
				broadcast yaml value "%loop-value-2%.%loop-value-3%" from loop-value-1
```

---

### Effect (Delete yaml)
Unloads a yaml file from memory and deletes the file

#### Syntax

`delete [y[a]ml] %string%`

---

### Effect (Delete all or any loaded yaml from directory)
Unloads a directory of yaml files from memory and deletes them

#### Syntax

`delete (all|any) [y[a]ml] from [(1¦non[(-| )]relative)] director(y|ies) %strings%`

`delete (all|any) loaded [y[a]ml] from [(1¦non[(-| )]relative)] director(y|ies) %strings% [using [the] filename as [the] id]`

---

### Effect (Unload yaml)
Unloads one or more yaml files from memory
 - If using the `[(1¦director(y|ies))]` option the input string must be a directory instead of an id

#### Syntax

`unload [y[a]ml] [(1¦director(y|ies))] %strings%`

#### Example

```
unload yaml "config"
```
---

### Effect (Save yaml)
Saves the current cached yaml elements to file
 - Using the `[with an indentation of %-number%]` option allows you to save the file with a different amount of spacing between 1 and 10
#### Syntax

`save [y[a]ml] %strings% [with an indentation of %-number%] [(1¦[and] with(out| no) extra lines between nodes)]`

#### Example

```
save yaml "config"

save yaml "config" with an indentation of 2
```
---

## Expressions

### Expression (Return all cached yaml)
Returns a list of all 'cached' yaml file ids
  - Using `from (director(y|ies) %-strings%` option gets ids from only said directories

#### Syntax

`[(the|all [(of the|the)])] [currently] loaded y[a]ml [files] [from (director(y|ies) %-strings%|all directories)]`

#### Example

```
set {_list::*} to the currently loaded yaml files
broadcast "%{_list::*}%"

loop the loaded yaml
	broadcast loop-value

loop the loaded yaml from directory "plugins\skript-yaml"
	broadcast loop-value
```
---

### Expression (Return all cached yaml directories)
Returns a list of directories from all 'cached' yaml file ids

#### Syntax

`[(the|all [(of the|the)])] [currently] loaded y[a]ml directories`

#### Example

```
loop the loaded yaml directories
	broadcast loop-value
```
---

### Expression (Yaml)
Gets, sets, removes values/node keys etc.. of a cached yaml file
  - Requires the id used/created from the load effect
  - This expression does not save to file
  - Lists accept list variables for input
  - Using 'without string checks' optional is a tiny bit faster but doesn't check/convert strings for numbers or booleans
  - Using '(node|path) list' only gets a list of nodes at that path (full names like 'rootnode.subnode' are returned)

#### Syntax

`[[skript-]y[a]ml] (1¦value|2¦(node|path) list|3¦(node|path)[s with] keys|4¦list) %string% (of|in|from) %string% [without string checks]`

#### Examples

```
set yaml value "test1.test2" from "config" to "test3"
set yaml list "list.name" from "config" to {_list::*}

set {_test} to yaml value "test1.test2" from "config"
broadcast "%{_test}%"
```
```
on script load:
	load yaml "plugins/skript-yaml/teleport.yml" as "plugins/skript-yaml/teleport.yml"
	
command /savetp:
	trigger:
		set yaml value "%player%.location" from "plugins/skript-yaml/teleport.yml" to location of player
		save yaml "plugins/skript-yaml/teleport.yml"

command /tp:
	trigger:
		teleport player to yaml value "%player%.location" from "plugins/skript-yaml/teleport.yml"
```
---

### Expression (Yaml list value)
Gets, sets, removes values from a list in a cached yaml file
  - Requires index between 1 and the size of the list
  - Requires the id used/created from the load effect
  - This expression does not save to file
  - Using 'without string checks' optional is a tiny bit faster but doesn't check/convert strings for numbers or booleans

#### Syntax

`[[skript-]y[a]ml] (index|value) %number% (of|in|from) list %string% (of|in|from) %string% [without string checks]`

#### Examples

```
set index 1 in list "test1.test2" from "config" to "test3"

set {_test} to yaml index 1 in list "test1.test2" from "config"
broadcast "%{_test}%"
```

---

### Expression (All yaml nodes)
Gets a list of all nodes of a cached yaml file

#### Syntax

`[all] [[skript-]y[a]ml] (node|path)[s] (of|in|from) %string%`

#### Example

```
set yaml value "test1.test2" from "config" to "test3"
set yaml value "boop.beep" from "config" to "bop"

set {_list::*} to all yaml nodes of "config"
broadcast "%{_list::*}%"
```
---

### Expression (Yaml comment or header)
Gets, sets, deletes comments or the header of a cached yaml file
  - Headers don't contain '#' so add it yourself if you want it
  - Comments can only be at root level ie. 'root' not 'root.something'
  - Both comment and header expressions can be set to multiple elements
  - This expression does not save to file

#### Syntax

`[the] comment[s] (of|from) [y[a]ml] node[s] %strings% (of|in|from) %string%" [(1¦with [an] extra line)]`

`[the] (comment[s] (at|on) [the] top of |header (of|from)) %string% [(1¦with [an] extra line)]`

#### Example

```
set the comments of yaml node "test" from "config" to "First line" and "Second line"
delete the comments of yaml node "test" from "config"

set {_header::*} to "First line" and "Second line"
set the comments at the top of "config" to {_header::*}
delete  the comments at the top of "config"

set the header of "config" to "First line" and "Second line"
delete  the header of "config"
set the header of "config" to {_header::*}
```
---

### Expression (Yaml loop)
Loop expressions to use while looping a yaml expression
  - Only works while using [yaml node list](#expression-yaml), [yaml node keys](#expression-yaml) and [yaml list](#expression-yaml)
  - `loop-id` gets the id used in the yaml expression
  - `loop-val` gets a value at that node if one exists
  - `loop-list` gets a list at that node if one exists
  - `loop-node` gets the full path plus key
  - `loop-key` gets just the keys
  - `loop-subnodekeys` gets any subnode from the current node (does not work on lists)


#### Syntax

`[the] loop-(1¦id|2¦val|3¦list|4¦node|5¦key|6¦subnodekey[s]|7¦iteration)`

#### Example
Yaml file:

```yaml
settings:
  subnode1: value1
  subnode2: value2
node:
  subnode1: value1
  subnode2: value2
node2:
- listValue1
- listValue2

```
Skript file:


```
loop yaml node keys "node" from "config":
	broadcast yaml value "%loop-node%" from "%loop-id%"
```
---

## Conditions

### Condition (Is yaml loaded)
Checks if one or more yaml files are loaded into memory using said id

#### Syntax

`y[a]ml[s] %strings% (is|are) loaded`

`y[a]ml[s] %strings% ((are|is) not|(is|are)n[']t) loaded`

---

### Condition (Is yaml empty)
Only checks if there are any nodes or not

#### Syntax

`[skript-]y[a]ml %string% is[(n't| not)] empty`

---

### Condition (Does yaml path have value)
Checks if one or more values exist at a path in a cached YAML file using said ID.
  - First input is the path
  - Second input is the id
  - If multiple paths are checked at once it will return false on the first one found to not contain a value.

#### Syntax

`[skript-]y[a]ml [(node|path)[s]] %strings% (of|in|from) %string% has [a] value[s]`

`[skript-]y[a]ml [(node|path)[s]] %strings% (of|in|from) %string% does(n't| not) have [a] value[s]`

#### Example

```
set skript-yaml value "test.test" from "config" to "test"

yaml path \"test.test\" in \"config\" has value:
    broadcast "has value"
```
---

### Condition (Does yaml path exist)
Checks if one or more paths exist in a cached yaml file using said id
  - First input is the path
  - Second input is the id
  - If multiple paths are checked at once it will return false on the first one found to not exist

#### Syntax

`[skript-]y[a]ml [(node|path)[s]] %strings% (of|in|from) %string% exists`

`[skript-]y[a]ml [(node|path)[s]] %strings% (of|in|from) %string% does(n't| not) exist`

#### Example

```
set skript-yaml value "test.test" from "config" to "test"
set skript-yaml value "test2.test2" from "config" to "test"

yaml path "test.test" and "test2.test2" in "config" exists:
    broadcast "this works"
yaml path "test.test" and "boop.boop" in "config" exists:
    broadcast "this will fail"
```
---

### Condition (Does yaml path have list)
Checks if one or more paths contain a list in a cached yaml file using said id
  - First input is the path
  - Second input is the id
  - If multiple paths are checked at once it will return false on the first one found to not exist

#### Syntax

`[skript-]y[a]ml [(node|path)[s]] %string% (of|in|from) %string% has [a] list`

`[skript-]y[a]ml [(node|path)[s]] %string% (of|in|from) %string% does(n't| not) have [a] list`

#### Example

```
if yaml node "listnode" from "example" has list:
	loop yaml list "listnode" from "example":
		broadcast "%loop-val%"

```
---

### Condition (Does yaml exist)
Checks if a yaml file exists
  - You really shouldn't have to use this since the [load yaml](#effect-load-yaml) effect creates one if it doesn't already exist
  - Input is the yaml file path


#### Syntax

`[(1¦non[(-| )]relative)] y[a]ml file %string% exists`

`[(1¦non[(-| )]relative)] y[a]ml file %string% does(n't| not) exist`
